## My Engineering Story
14-year old me first got into engineering by joining my middle/high school 
robotics team (those were the same institutions for me). During those years I
competed in an annual underwater ROV competition, which focused primarily on
accomplishing basic manipulation and piloting tasks that ROVs may be required to
do in the field, e.g. collecting samples, opening gates, turning valves, and so
on. These challenges test you on these specific skills:
* Designing mechanical systems that are as robust as possible
* Designing a control system (including both electronics and software) to
  control with sufficiently high fidelity and low latency to accomplish those tasks
* Piloting your creation sufficiently well

I had a lot of fun doing these challenges, and I spent 4 years learning a ton of
technical skills from it, but I think my perception of the field as a whole got
distorted as a result - industry robotics works nothing like this does, and
there are a whole lot of other considerations that require a whole lot of people
and a whole lot of time to execute well.

Looking back on my experience engineering and leading projects, here are some of
my key takeaways:
1. Very few complicated systems are ever built alone. If they are it's over a period of
   *years* with even more years of prior experience in building things.
2. It's okay to take extra time to build up a robust foundation before submitting your
   robot to compete. We were definitely in a position where we were able to do
   so, and I don't think scrapping your design over and over every single year
   is a good idea in the interest of saving time, saving money, and ensuring
   team longevity.
