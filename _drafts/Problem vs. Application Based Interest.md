blurb: a random thought I had about understanding how interest in a topic works
---

There are two ways in which I've noticed my career interests have went:
1. Process-focused: I enjoy the process of doing something
2. Problem-focused: I like the problem the work is trying to solve
Not necessarily trying to say that one is "better" than another, but I'd like to
explore the potential implications of this way of thinking.
