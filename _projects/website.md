I'm planning on making this more of a place to dump my thoughts on how this
website is designed, and how I might want to change things in the near future.

## Tech Stack
I'm currently hosting this on Github Pages, using Jekyll as the static site
generator, and SCSS for styling.

## Appearance & Content
I have three main goals for this website:
1. Get my professional work public
2. Get some of my thoughts public
3. Make it look as personalized as possible

To that end, I'm starting off with something incredibly simple, and I'll add to
it once I know what direction I want it to go in and how to execute it.

Currently using EB Garamond for the main font.
