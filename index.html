	  hello, i'm kyle hu!
    <br><br>
    currently a master's student at the university of california, san diego.
    <br><br>
    my main area of research is in designing embedded systems to aid in wildlife study and conservation (check out <a href="https://e4e.ucsd.edu">my lab</a>). currently working on using laser pointers to measure fish lengths.

    why falafel72? 
    the name was for a throwaway for some random game i knew i would only play once or twice - it's stuck with me ever since.
    fun fact: i'd never had falafel when i made the name. i have since, and i love it!
