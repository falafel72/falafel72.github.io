	hello, i'm kyle hu!
    <br><br>
    i'm a recently graduated master's student from the university of california, san diego.
    <br><br>
    i most recently wrote a thesis on some algorithms i designed for a fish length measurement device, which you can find <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt41x511ht/qt41x511ht.pdf">here</a>!
    <br><br>
    why falafel72? 
    the name was for a throwaway for some random game i knew i would only play once or twice - it's stuck with me ever since.
    fun fact: i'd never had falafel when i made the name. i have since, and i love it!
