title: About Me
---
<p class="about-text">currently a master's student at the university of california, san diego. i'm researching a way to measure fish lengths using laser pointers (yes, really)
<br><br>
my main area of research is in designing embedded systems to aid in wildlife study and conservation. check out <a href="https://e4e.ucsd.edu">my lab</a>, they do cool stuff!
<br><br>
why falafel72? i've always felt a lot of pressure when coming up with online usernames for myself. 
funnily enough i started using falafel72 cause i needed an account for some online game i knew i'd only play once or twice, and the name sounded funny. 
it's stuck with me ever since. fun fact: i'd never had falafel when i made the name. i have since, and i love it!
